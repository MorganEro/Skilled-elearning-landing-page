## My process

I created my variables for colors and fonts. Then created css for repeated styles.
Next I completed the mobile view. I then created the tablet view. Lastly, I created the Desktop view. After all the views were created, I checked for a responsive flow and made edits to the css to make sure everything looked as close to the figma and preview designs as I could.
After matching the design, I checked my lighthouse score and made some edits to improve the performance.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am still improving my usage of em, rem, and px. Trying to find the best time to use each one by experimenting. I think I might have overused em and rem on this project.

### Continued development

I am still confused by why some of the dimensions don't seem to match up between my developer tool preview and figma files. The differences aren't consistent so I am exploring and being more attentive about it.
